Onion Browser is the original free and open-source Tor-powered web browser for iOS. Onion Browser helps you access the internet with more safety and privacy, and no extra cost to you.

“The best Tor-related offering on iOS right now is Onion Browser” - The Daily Dot, October 14, 2015.

Featured in: The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Boing Boing, Lifehacker, Macworld, The Daily Dot, & others.

FEATURES:
• Browse the internet over Tor:
- Protect your privacy from website tracking.
- Secure your traffic from insecure wireless networks and ISPs.
- Support for HTTPS Everywhere, an automatic switch to HTTPS enabled websites.
- Access .onion sites that are only accessible over Tor.

• Fight online tracking: block scripts and automatically clear cookies and tabs, based on your preferences.

• And more privacy-enhancing features!

DISCLAIMERS:
- Web browsing is much slower than through a normal web browser or a VPN because your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network.

- Multimedia often bypass Tor and compromise your privacy; video files and video streams are blocked by default and are not supported by Onion Browser.

- Onion Browser might not work on networks with advanced network restrictions. If the app does not connect, try using bridges (or a different type of bridge), force-quit, and then restart the app.

- Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.
